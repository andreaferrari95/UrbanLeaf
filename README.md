# Functionality disclosure

Unfortunately, the Teleport API has been retired from the web so the website is not working anymore. This is now a boilerplate waiting for a similar API to be available.


# UrbanLeaf, the idea

This project has been built as an assignment for the JavaScript section of my studies with Start2Impact. The initial assignment was to build an application that uses the Teleport public API to call a specific set of information about a city that has been searched
using the "Google-like" search bar. I wanted to make it more to my taste and complex, so I have added some more functionality.

**The data required for the assignment:**
- City Score of the searched city;✅
- Description of the searched city;✅
- Categories of the searched city; ✅

**The extra implementation I added:**
 - Current weather;✅
 - Weather Icon;✅
 - Current date and time;✅
 - Current Humidity;✅
 - Air Quality;✅
 - Wind speed;✅
 - Air Pressure;✅
 - Main Pollutant;✅
 - Wind Direction.✅

**Also, I have decided to add a Default city to show how the result would look and I also implemented a Geolocation button that when clicked, if given permission automatically fetches all the previous data for the user location based on latitude and longitude.**
